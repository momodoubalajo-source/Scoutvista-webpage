    <h2>What your CloudVista AI actually does for you</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Think of it as a scout that knows your market, your network and what a
      “real” opportunity looks like in your world. It keeps learning from the
      accounts you upload, the signals you save and the conversations that
      actually turn into revenue.

        <h3>Knows your market</h3>
        <p>
          CloudVista watches the sectors, geographies and segments you care about –
          funding, hiring, people moves, new units – then frames them through the
          lens of your go-to-market.
        </p>

        <h3>Knows your network</h3>
        <p>
          Plug in your CRM, LinkedIn exports or simple client lists. CloudVista
          tracks the people and organisations you already know, surfacing warm,
          relationship-led angles instead of cold lists.

        <h3>Learns what “good” looks like</h3>
        <p>
          Like, save and act on signals. Over time your feed becomes sharply
          personalised – less noise, more “this looks exactly like the deals you
          actually close”.
